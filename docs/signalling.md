# Social Signalling

## Introduction

Social signalling could be defined as a non-verbal communication among animals to express their beliefs, intensions, 
and feelings in order to reveal a hidden information. Before the invention of modern 
languages, no one knows exactly how our distant ancestors communicated but one of 
these hypothesis is that they developed non-verbal communication through body expressions. 
Expressions are represented by different postures or  attitudes. 
Accordingly social animals (such as human) could organise themselves to have such a 
behaviour as a response to a specific posture. After that postures were evolved to be gestures.
``` 
A gesture signifies that the sender subconsciously share the same interpretation of the act 
with receivers which in turn they respond to the intention not the physical action
```
In the era of big data and digital social media we have a mix of complicated verbal and non-verbal signals that enables us 
to convey an information in a better way but still we have the lack of knowledge of how we can transfer honest signals.
This series tries to address social signalling, signalling theory, social supernets or social network sites (SNS) 
as a means for understanding the soft-power of social signalling in the modern era.

## Principal-Agent Problem   

Signalling theory term was formalised in 1970 by George Akerlof. In his [paper - The Market for "Lemons"](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/84/3/488/1896241?redirectedFrom=fulltext),
he studied the market of used cars where the owner of the used car "an agent" knows the quality of 
the car, however a potential buyer "a principal" has no clue about some hidden information. 
So you might see the basic attributes (such as internal and external colors, manufacturer, 
body style) where any used car should hold but there are also hidden attributes such safety 
ratings, preventive maintenance and etc. This what is called "The principal-agent problem" . 
It is also know as asymmetric information problem which defines ...

We can overcome the principal-agent problem as follows (Not all of them are valid for some use cases):
* The agent could share ownership scheme. For instance, some companies offer s
tock options in order to make employees become more committed to their company. 
However, in some cases such as [insider trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insider_trading), managers could leak non-public 
information in order to manipulate the share price.
